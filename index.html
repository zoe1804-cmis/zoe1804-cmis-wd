				Lists and Links Assignment
			</h2>
			<p>
				In this assignment I learned how to create and add lists and links into html. I figured out how to add unordered lists as well as ordered lists and how to put links in a website.
				<ul>
					<li>
						Create a new folder called "listsandlinks" in your repository folder.
					</li>
					<li>
						Inside listsandlinks create a file called "index.html" and a file called "main.css"
					</li>
					<li>	
						In index.html create an ordered list of step by step instructions to create a new webpage on the production server.
					</li>
					<li>
						Also create an unordered list of 5 or more links to websites with useful webdesign related information.
					</li>
					<li>
						In the nav section, create an unordered list of links with a link back to your main index page.
					</li>
					<li>
						In your main index.html file in public_html, add an unordered list of links to the nav section with a link to "listsandlinks".
					</li>
					<li>
						In your old index.html, add an article with a heading and a paragraph description of this assignment. Also add an unordered list that contains this list of requirements. 
					</li>
					<li>
						Turn in your work.
					</li>
				</ul>
