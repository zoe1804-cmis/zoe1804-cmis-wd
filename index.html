				Lists and Links Assignment
			</h2>
			<p>
				In this assignment I learned how to create and add lists and links into html. I figured out how to add unordered lists as well as ordered lists and how to put links in a website.
			</p>

					</li>
					<li>
						Inside listsandlinks create a file called "index.html" and a file called "main.css"

			<h2>
				Tables
			</h2>
			<p>
				In this assignment we worked on creating tables. We experimented with colspan and rowspan and we learned about the elements of an HTML table. I created a webpage called Tables and on it I created 3 tables. The first is just a simple grid, the second is a calandar, and the third is a class schedule.
			</p>
			<h3>

			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Create a new folder in your repository called "tables"
					</li>
					<li>
						In the "tables" folder, create a new file called from your template "index.html"
					</li>
