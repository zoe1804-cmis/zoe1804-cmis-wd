					The first step is to open your terminal and enter into your repository folder
				</li>
        		<li> 
					Next, you should open your html file and add any css files that are necissary. Make sure to type &amp; in order to stay in your repository folder once gedit is opened.
				</li>
				<li> 
					After that you should code your html file and css file as desired.
				</li>
				<li> 
					Make sure to validate your html and css files regularly
				</li>
				<li> 
					Next, you need to enter into the proxy server by typing: python -m SimpleHTTPServer. This allows you to view your work if you type in localhost:8000 into the search bar. Make sure to keep validating!
				</li>
				<li> 
					Once you are done coding your CSS and HTML files, you should save them on gedit and git add, commit, and push it to save it to your github account
				</li>
				<li> 
					After you have saved your files to github, you need to upload them to the production server. You do this by typing sftp(username)@cmis-hsteacher. Make sure you are in your repository when you do this. You will probably have to type in your sftp password and the word yes to the question posed.
				</li>
				<li> 
					Then when you type ls it will show you that there is just one folder there. Enter this folder and it should contain the files in your repository.
				</li>
				<li> 
					Then you need to add your new files to the production server by typing put (filename). Now you can leave sftp by simply typing exit.
				</li>
				<li> 
					Lastly check your work from the site once again to see if it looks like you wanted it to. If it does then congratulations! You made a website!
